 <small>As you can see, avocados are exceptionally<br /> nutritious fruits and are a concentrated source of<br /> healthy fats and fiber, plus a number of vitamins<br /> and minerals.</small>
</p>
<p>
 <small><b><i><mark> They’re are rich in nutrients that are often lacking in<br /> many people’s diets, including magnesium, B6,<br /> vitamin C, vitamin E, and folate (4<sup>&checkmark;</sup>)</b></i></mark>.</small>
</p>
<p>
 <small> For example, half of an avocado packs 10<sub>%</sub> of the DV<br /> for potassium.</small>
</p>
<p>
  <small><b><i><mark>Potassium is considered a "nutrient of public health<br /> concern" by the U.S. Department of Health and<br /> Human Services</b></i></mark>. This is because it’s a mineral that<br /> Americans commonly do not consume enough of (5<sup>&checkmark;</sup>).</small>
</p>
<p>
  <small>In fact, a study that included data on 4,730 U.S.<br /> adults found that fewer than 3% had potassium<br /> intakes greater than the set adequate intake for<br /> potassium of 4,700 mg per day (6<sup>&checkmark;</sup>).</small>
</p>
<p>
  <small><b><i><mark>Potassium is needed for several critical bodily<br /> functions, including blood pressure regulation and<br /> nervous system function. Getting the recommended<br /> amount of potassium on a daily basis may help<br /> protect against hypertension and stroke (7<sup>&checkmark;</sup>, 8<sup>&checkmark;</sup>)</b></i></mark>.</small>
</p>
<p>
  <small>Avocados also provide nutrients that are essential<br /> for the health of the immune system, including<br /> vitamin C, B6, and E (9<sup>&checkmark;</sup>, 10<sup>&checkmark;</sup>).<small>
</p>
<p>
 <small><b><i><mark>Half of an avocado provides 15% of your daily needs<br />for B6, a nutrient that helps suppress inflammation<br /> and protect against oxidative damage. Inadequate<br /> B6 intake may negatively impact immune function<br /> and increase susceptibility to illness (9<sup>&checkmark;</sup>, 11<sup>&checkmark;</sup>, 12<sup>&checkmark;</sup>)</b></i></mark>.</small>
</p>
<p>
<small>While severe B6 deficiency is rare, having<br />suboptimal or slightly deficient levels is more<br />common, even in the United States and Canada (13<sup>&checkmark;</sup>).</small>
</p>
<p>
  <small>Avocados contain an abundance of nutrients that are<br />essential for optimal health, and regularly consuming<br />avocados could help improve overall diet quality.</small>
